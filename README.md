# Abaqus-Aluminum-Bending-Ductile-Damage-3D
In this project, the three-dimensional bending of a sample made from extruded aluminum alloy EN AW-7108 T6 is analyzed in a 3D space. Note that this is a simple example. However, if you need more information about ductile damage in Abaqus and its modeling using the VUMAT subroutine, you can visit the CAE Assistant website.
The material behavior is considered elasto-plastic, and the ductile damage criterion is also taken into account. The material properties are shown in the next figure.

As shown in the next figure, significant deformations are applied to the sample in this analysis.

It is worth mentioning that this case is taken from the Abaqus documentation and is included here so you can download the .inp files for Abaqus versions 2022 and 2024. For other versions, please refer to Abaqus' official documentation.
